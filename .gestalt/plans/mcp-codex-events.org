#+TITLE: MCP codex/event Notifications in Session Console
#+SUBTITLE: Display Codex MCP JSON-RPC event notifications in session output
#+DATE: 2026-02-01
#+KEYWORDS: mcp codex event json-rpc session console terminal

* DONE [#A] Store Codex MCP event notifications to file
Effort: M
Goal: Stop printing MCP notifications to the terminal and persist them to `.gestalt/sessions/Events-<session-name>-<date>`.
Notes: Logging must be opt-in via `session.log-codex-events` (default false).

** DONE [#A] Add config switch for codex event logging
Why: Logging should be configurable and default to off.
Change: Introduce `session.log-codex-events` in `config/gestalt.toml` (default false) and wire it through settings/options.
Tests: Extend settings/config tests to cover the new default.
Done when: Config key parses and defaults to false.

** DONE [#A] Write MCP notifications to file instead of terminal
Why: Users want events persisted without terminal noise.
Change: Add a session-scoped MCP event logger that writes NDJSON lines to `Events-<session-name>-<date>` in the session log dir. Update `mcpPty` notification handling to write to file when enabled and omit terminal output.
Tests: Add tests that notifications no longer surface in output, and that the event file receives the notification payload.
Done when: Events are quiet in the terminal and persisted when enabled.

** DONE [#B] Ensure cleanup and error handling for event logs
Why: Avoid file handle leaks and silent failures.
Change: Close the event logger on session/pty close and warn when logging is enabled but no session log dir is configured.
Tests: Add a close-path unit test if needed.
Done when: Event logging resources are cleaned up reliably.

* DONE [#A] Confirm scope + output UX for codex/event notifications
Effort: S
Goal: Lock output formatting, filtering, and any opt-in/opt-out behavior before implementation.
Notes: Keep basic functionality; no new dependencies; preserve existing session behavior.

** DONE [#A] Clarify formatting + filtering rules
Why: The console output is user-facing; we need a stable, minimal format that won’t flood or confuse.
Change: Use a consistent line prefix for all MCP notifications: `[mcp <method>]`. For `codex/event`, append best-effort `msg.type` and `msg.message` as `"[mcp codex/event] <type>: <message>"`. For other methods or missing fields, append a compact JSON string of params (truncated to a safe length) as `"[mcp <method>] <params>"`. Decision: show all MCP notifications in the console (not just codex/event). Meta fields (requestId/threadId) are omitted by default to reduce noise; include only if you want them surfaced later.\n\nProposed defaults (if you accept):\n- Example: `[mcp codex/event] task_started: generating response`\n- Example: `[mcp initialized] {\"capabilities\":{...}}`\n- Truncation: 512 chars after prefix, add `…` to indicate truncation.\n- No ANSI styling or colors.\nTests: N/A (decision).\nDone when: You confirm the proposed format or provide an alternative.

** DONE [#B] Confirm when events should appear
Why: Notifications can arrive while idle or during tool calls; current flow only surfaces events during awaits.
Change: Decide that codex/event notifications must be printed immediately upon receipt, even when no call is in flight.
Tests: N/A (decision).
Done when: We agree events must appear even when the session is idle.

* DONE [#A] Backend: route MCP notifications to session output
Effort: M
Goal: Ensure codex/event JSON-RPC notifications are surfaced in the session console reliably.
Notes: Keep implementation minimal; avoid over-engineering; reuse existing mcpPty output path.

** DONE [#A] Make readLoop handle notifications directly
Why: Notifications can arrive outside request/response waits; current flow only processes them when awaiting a response.
Change: In `internal/terminal/pty_mcp.go`, parse each NDJSON message and immediately call `handleNotification` when `Method` is set; only enqueue messages with `ID` to the response channel.
Tests: Add unit test that sends a codex/event notification without a pending request and verifies it is written to session output.
Done when: codex/event notifications show in session output even when no call is active.

** DONE [#A] Update handleNotification to always show notifications
Why: Current behavior only prints in debug mode, which hides notifications from users.
Change: Adjust `handleNotification` to always emit a line for all MCP notifications, using the format in the previous step. Keep existing parsing of `params.msg.type`/`params.msg.message` for codex/event as best-effort, and add a compact JSON fallback for other methods or missing fields. Truncate long params to a safe length.\nTests: Unit test that codex/event results in a readable line (format confirmed in Step 1), with best-effort parsing and a safe fallback; add a test for a non-codex notification line with truncation.\nDone when: MCP notifications are printed consistently regardless of debug settings and the output format matches the decision.

** DONE [#B] Define the notification contract used for formatting
Why: We need a minimal, documented expectation for event payload parsing to avoid brittle logic.
Change: Document (in code comments or docs) the expected `codex/event` params shape: `{ _meta: { requestId, threadId }, id, msg: { type, message } }`, and that parsing is best-effort.
Tests: N/A (documentation).
Done when: The expected event envelope and fallback behavior are captured.

* DONE [#B] Tests + validation
Effort: M
Goal: Prevent regressions and verify event visibility without impacting normal MCP responses.
Notes: Use existing MCP test helpers; keep tests small and deterministic.

** DONE [#B] Add notification output test for idle session
Why: Ensure notifications appear even when no tool call is pending.
Change: Extend `internal/terminal/pty_mcp_notify_test.go` (or add a new test) to inject a `codex/event` notification via the fake MCP server and assert the session output stream includes the formatted event line.
Tests: Unit test described above.
Done when: Test passes and fails without the new routing change.

** DONE [#B] Preserve response handling behavior
Why: Ensure requests still match responses and output remains stable.
Change: Add a small test (or extend existing ones) that interleaves a `codex/event` notification between request and response and verifies the response still completes and output includes both event line and assistant response.
Tests: Unit test in `internal/terminal/pty_mcp_test.go` or `internal/terminal/pty_mcp_notify_test.go`.
Done when: Both event output and normal response behavior are verified.

* DONE [#C] Rollout + docs (optional)
Effort: S
Goal: Ensure user expectations are captured without changing external APIs.
Notes: Optional unless you want explicit doc updates.

** DONE [#C] Update docs/notes if desired
Why: Make it discoverable that MCP event notifications appear in console output.
Change: Add a short note to `internal/codexmcp/README.md` or a relevant docs file about codex/event output formatting.
Tests: N/A.
Done when: Documentation reflects the new behavior.

* DONE [#A] Open questions
Effort: S
Goal: Resolve ambiguities before implementation.
Notes: These block final design.

** DONE [#A] Confirm display format and verbosity
Why: Avoid user confusion or log spam.
Change: Provide your preferred line format and whether to include meta (requestId/threadId), plus whether to show non-codex notifications.
Tests: N/A.
Done when: You confirm the final display rules.

** DONE [#B] Confirm whether events should also emit to notify/workflow bus
Why: You might want codex/event to feed workflows or logs, not just console output.
Change: Decision: console-only for now; do not emit MCP notifications to notify/workflow buses.
Tests: N/A.
Done when: Scope captured (console-only).
