## Decision making

- In code prefer minimalism, clarity and short comments.
- Do not add dependencies unless clearly stated in the plan.
- Choose well known algorithms over inventing new ones.
- Always write code that is elegant and readable for humans.
- Never over-engineer. Prefer the simplest viable approach.
- Think harder, challenge first ideas, weight alternatives.
- When taking decisions ask for help if you have doubts.
