## Decision making

- Ask clarifications only if you have strong doubts.
- Do not add dependencies unless clearly stated in the work plan.
- Choose well known algorithms over inventing new ones.
- Never over-engineer. Prefer the simplest viable approach.
- When generating code prefer minimalism.
- Always write code that is elegant and readable for humans.
- Integrate code with short comments when needed.
- When thinking, always challenge first choice.
