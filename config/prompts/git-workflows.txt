# Git Workflows

Use these steps to keep changes clean and reviewable.

## Safe sync
1. `git status` to confirm a clean working tree.
2. `git fetch --all --prune` to update remote refs.
3. `git rebase origin/main` (or your target branch) to keep history linear.

## New branch setup

git checkout -b feature/<short-name> (or fix/<short-name> if appropriate)

## New Commit

Commit in small, reviewable chunks, all files you modify or
add. Commit message should have a title on one line and a short
description. In case of more complex commits, reuse the related L2
instructions and include them too below.

git add path/to/file
git commit

## Check history

If for any reason you need to trace back changes, check commit history

git log --oneline --decorate -n 10

## Recover tips

To find previous HEAD positions:

git reflog

## Prepare for push

Squash or fixup commits if needed.

Don't push commits yourself, notice your work is finished.
