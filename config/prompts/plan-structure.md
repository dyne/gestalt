Projects always have a PLAN, it's in ./gestalt/PLAN.org (Org-mode):
1. L1 = first-level heading (*)
2. L2 = second-level heading (**)
Their headings are marked (XOR marks):
- implemented (DONE)
- to be done (TODO)
- being worked on (WIP).

The contents of the PLAN are the best source of knowledge on the
project strategy: how it has been developed and what decisions have
been taken so far. It is your first go-to resource in case you want
more context on your current task: consult it before asking questions
and refer to previous choices made in it in case you think to change
strategy.
