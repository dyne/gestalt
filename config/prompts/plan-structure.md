Projects always have a PLAN and all plans are Org-Mode files (.org extension) in .gestalt:
1. L1 = first-level heading (*)
2. L2 = second-level heading (**)

Their headings are marked (XOR marks):
- implemented (DONE)
- to be done (TODO)
- being worked on (WIP).

The contents of a PLAN are the best source of knowledge on the project
strategy: how it has been developed and what decisions have been taken
so far. Your assigned PLAN gives instructions and context on your
current task: consult it before asking questions and refer to previous
choices made in it in case you think to change strategy.
