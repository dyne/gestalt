I want you to help improve the quality of this software by reviewing
all its code with attention to code clarity and maintainability. I
want you also to suggest how to minimize dependencies when its easy,
since I love minimalism and efficiency. Optimizations are also
welcome. What is most important however is maintainability and
modularization so that the code is easy to maintain and also to modify
in parts without breaking things.
